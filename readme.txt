## This tool is a short script created to assist with the physical mapping of positions in
## the game Subnautica. It requires the nearest marked direction on the compass, number of
## scale divisions (including decimals) either before or after the nearest marked direction
## proceeding clockwise from due North, and the distance to lifepod 5 in metres. The script
## returns distances North and East from lifepod 5 in metres, as well as in mm for a scale
## of 50mm/km.
